- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a junior data scientist who decided to change his career path from civil engineering to IT. I bring a couple of years of experience in real estate project management which means I like challenges, Iâ€™m good at math and have advanced problem solving skills. Big data is a huge opportunity to create something more effective and useful. I want to take advantage of this and see where it gets us!
